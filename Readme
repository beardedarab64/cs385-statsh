This program was developed to simulate the behavior of a shell like bash. It complies with the 
minimum requirements specified in the project description document, and does not implement any of
the optional requirements proposed in the document.

This program defines 2 main class objects declared in Command.h and Job.h, respectively. It also
uses different helper methods defined in CFuncs.h, and Misc.h

Command.h:	Represents a single command such as "ls -l" or "cp file1 file2". This is the object
			that performs the actual fork() operation

Job.h:		Represents an entire job composed of many commands entered by the user at the command
			prompt. These commands can be pipelined and/or asked to run in the background. This
			object defines/creates the input/output file descriptors that the actual commands
			are going to use as their input and output.

CFuncs.h:	Contains wrappers of C-system functions that check for errors.

Misc.h		Declares multiple-purpose operations such as tokenize() to split strings between a 
			specified character like a space.
